Welcome to day one of your new Initial Outfitters business!

This is the first of your 30 Daily Action Emails. These emails are designed to steer you to the activities that will make the biggest impact in your business.

Great news! Help is here! Your sponsor is your closest support as you kick off your new business, so stay in touch with her. High Heel Camp is the first training resource you will use as you learn best practices for every action we suggest. So, read below to learn what fun activities await you today and how you get in step with High Heel Camp to guide you.

Let's get this party started!

Have you booked your first 4-6 parties over the next 45 days? If not, TODAY is the day! If you have, don't stop! A full calendar of home parties puts you on the path to a super start.

Prepare to show off! Introduce your new business to everyone you know by hosting a business debut or launch party as one of your first 4-6 parties. Schedule yours on your calendar within the next two weeks.

Make friends with FRANK to build your contact list.

Reflect for a moment on your motivation for starting your new business. What do you really want to accomplish? It is essential to your success that you understand why you're starting your business. You'll be challenged to write down your 'why' soon and share it with your sponsor, so start thinking about it today.

Each of today's priorities is discussed in detail in Module 101 of High Heel Camp. You'll even find suggested scripts for booking your first parties. Log on to your virtual office using the instructions you received in your Initial Outfitters welcome email. Look for the blue banner on the home page that says High Heel Camp, read the overview and dive in! Don't miss the videos and supporting documents that go with many of the modules.

Congratulations! What a productive first day you've had!


The secret of getting ahead is getting started. ~ Sally Berger








Welcome to your 2nd Day! Turn your enthusiasm into action today!

CONNECT is your key word. Use your daily routine to make connections and generate interest in your new business. Share your excitement about your new business with everyone, everywhere.

Your telephone is one of the most effective communication methods for your new business. It enables your friends and family to hear and respond to the enthusiasm in your voice. Always be proactive, and pick up the phone as you work through your FRANK list inviting friends to your launch and to host a party. High Heel Camp Module 101 addresses this in detail.

Today is a great day to set up your personal website so that you can share our wonderful products as you connect with others. Find simple set-up instructions under Frequently Asked Questions in your virtual office Downloads (center top of home page) in the folder titled New Outfitters...What You Need to Know.

Have you found your buddy? Learn more about the impact of the buddy system in Module 101 of High Heel Camp.

It has been a fun day of making connections. You are on your way to building relationships that will serve as the backbone of your new business.


I didn't get there by wishing for it or hoping for it, but by working for it.
~ Estee Lauder










It's Day 3 already! Let's focus on your Super STARt!

Have you discussed the Super STARt incentive with your sponsor and marked your reward periods on your calendar? New consultants who jump in with both feet, and activate their businesses quickly are the ones who earn the highest rewards and have the greatest long-term success.

Speaking of rewards...how does it sound to get a raise? When you sell your first $1000 in personal volume (PV) you receive a 5% increase in your personal sales profit from then on! Earn even more in the coming months with our consistency bonus program.

Today you'll visit two other sections of your virtual office (also called back office). For now, focus on the areas we suggest, as you will utilize other resources later.
Notice the company announcements section on the left side of the home page (hover over the box to slow the scrolling.) Corporate and team calls will positively impact your business, so add these dates to your calendar now!
Create an Event for each of the parties you've booked, including your launch. You'll find easy instructions under Downloads (center top of home page). Locate the folder entitled New Outfitters...What You Need to Know. Then, find the document called Creating an Event for your Party.
You've made terrific progress today...planning to maximize your Super STARt rewards, learning about a raise, and utilizing your virtual office. Great job!  
Take the first step in faith. You don't have to see the whole staircase, just take the first step.
-Martin Luther King Jr.








Today is a high touch day!


High touch is how we describe communication methods that are the most personal: speaking with people in person, making phone calls and sending notes. High touch communication always gets the best response.

Continue calling and personally inviting friends and family to attend your launch party, and to host their own parties. Plan to mail printed invitations to your launch party about 10 days before the party date.

Our amazing hostess rewards and monthly customer and hostess specials give you more reasons to contact friends about hosting parties! In fact, our hostess rewards are among the most generous in the industry! Look over the hostess rewards chart in the front of the catalog and visit the Monthly Specials folder under Downloads in your back office. Review and discuss these with your sponsor.

Have you set up your Signature Style customer newsletter? This marketing tool, free for your first three months, is a must for keeping your name in front of your customers. You received an email from the home office with details. Set-up instructions can also be found in FAQ's in Downloads in your back office.

Where does social media fit in? It can be useful for promoting your business and making connections, but social media will never replace the core of our business, which is relationship-building from parties and other high touch communication. Start spreading the word about your new business on Facebook. You'll learn more tips on utilizing social media in the second track of High Heel Camp.

Ask your sponsor to add you to our private group for idea-sharing, encouragement, and information. The group is called Initial Success.


High touch is the way to go! Terrific job!


There are no shortcuts to any place worth going. ~Beverly Sills








It's time for a pat on the back!

So don't just sit there, get busy. Stretch your arm up, bend your elbow so that your hand is above your upper back, and start patting! Be proud of all that you have learned and accomplished in your first five days with Initial Outfitters. Most of all, we hope you are having fun!

Hostess coaching is your focus for today. Hostess coaching directly affects the number of guests who attend your parties, and the number of guests directly affects your sales, bookings, referrals and sponsoring leads. You can see why it is one of the greatest indicators of a successful party. Have you completed High Heel Camp Module 102 yet? This module breaks hostess coaching into bite-size pieces, but be sure to talk with your sponsor about any questions you have.

Discover our simple system called 3, 2, 1, Before, During and After in Module 102.

Print Hostess Coaching Checklists for each of the parties you've booked, plus your launch.

View the video to become familiar with the conversation flow when using the checklist.

Don't forget to 'coach yourself' to a successful launch party according to the checklist.


Your starter kit should be on its way to you by now! Track your shipment during transit so you can plan to celebrate on the day it arrives. For instructions on tracking your shipment, go to FAQ's in your virtual office Downloads in the folder entitled New Outfitters...What You Need to Know.


The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing. ~Walt Disney









Get ready for an exciting day!

We're going to talk about what happens at the party! Parties are the lifeblood of your business, and Initial Outfitters parties are so much fun! Module 103 in High Heel Camp is your first resource for simple and successful parties.

Learn about Intro and Go, which is your template to follow at your parties, including your launch. Make it your own by adding your creativity and personality. Make it interactive.

View the Intro and Go video to grasp the simplicity of it.

Talk with your sponsor about some of her favorite 'GO' ideas.

View the Time of Check-Out video to make the most of this critical time at your parties.

On another note, have you participated in a corporate or team call yet? Always schedule time to participate in the live call or listen the recording. You don't want to miss any information or training that will lead you to the success you desire.

What a fun day of party preparation it has been! Feel great about what you've accomplished! And, continue to share your excitement everywhere you go as you book parties and plan your launch. This is how you will build your business momentum.


Confidence is in the preparation.
~Richard Kline









Time to celebrate!

Your starter kit has most likely arrived by now, or will very soon! Don't you just love your new products? And, how special that your kit has your personal monogram!

Read over all of the literature. Play with your products and have fun! In fact, grab a few friends and show off your products to them. One of them may get so excited that she wants to join you as a consultant! Don't forget to call your sponsor and tell her your kit has arrived. She'll be eager to hear from you.

Did you notice your Initial Action Guide as part of your starter kit literature? Get your hands on it now and get started on this fun, interactive training tool! Start at the beginning, moving as quickly as possible to pages 9 and 10: What's Your Why and My Plan. Continue building your FRANK list with the memory joggers listed on page 13.

Keep sharing IO everywhere you go! Wear your jewelry and other products every day. Get ready to put your brochures and look books to work for you, too. Spend a few minutes labeling or stamping these and all of your marketing materials. Where will you go today to share your excitement about your new business and invite others to get involved?


Don't be afraid to go out on a limb. That's where the fruit is.
~ H. Jackson Browne







Wow! You've been in business for one week! Congratulations!

Are you having fun wearing your new products from your starter kit? When someone compliments you on them, tell them about your new business. If someone asks you a question you don't know the answer to, let them know that you're new, just learning, and will gladly get back with them. Now you have a perfect reason to talk with the person again to generate more interest in your products or in joining your team.

Today, let's get SMART! Let's talk about setting SMART goals for your business. S=specific, M= measurable, A= actionable, R= realistic, T= time-based. Use page 10 of your Initial Action Guide to establish your goals for your first three months. This page challenges you to create a plan to work your business so that you can achieve your goals, too.

Your business is flexible, but that doesn't mean it's optional. A good rule of thumb is to touch your business in some way every day. Let your sponsor help you determine if your plan is in step with your goals.

Be sure to share your goals and plan with your family or friends who are your support system. This accountability is important. Plus, sharing your goals means more fun when it's time to celebrate your success!


Every achievement, big or small, begins in your mind.
~Mary Kay Ash








Welcome to Day 9 where you will learn to market yourself and your new business in new ways! Ask your sponsor about ordering business cards, and make a plan to give them out when they arrive. Change the voice mail greeting on your phone. Change your email signature. And, remember to always label or stamp your marketing materials with your contact information.

Ready to get organized? Now that higher-priority activities have been getting your attention, it's a good idea to set up your home office area. Find a space where you can organize a few supplies in a file box or cabinet. You'll only need a few supplies such as labels or a stamp, manila folders, calculator, calendar, cash bag and pens. Be sure to create a simple system for tracking expenses for tax time so that you can keep good records and save receipts. Your sponsor can share ideas with you.

We recommend a separate checking account for depositing business checks. Also, obtain a separate credit or debit card for your business, or choose one of your current cards for business purposes. A great option is the Initial Outfitters personalized Visa debit card. You can find more information in the 2014 New Consultants...What You Need to Know folder in the back office.

You should be feeling more organized now. How are you doing with High Heel Camp and your Initial Action Guide? Continue working through these as you build a strong foundation for business success.


It's not who you are that holds you back, it's who you think you're not.

Your launch party is ever closer! It's going to be so much fun! Keep in mind your three main objectives for your launch: book parties, sell products, and share your excitement over your new IO business so that others might consider joining you in the business.

Share your enthusiasm while inviting friends and family until the day of your party! When someone says she can't attend, invite her to be one of your first hostesses. Introduce her to your amazing products by sharing a look book, a catalog or directing her to your website. Follow up to get her opinion and answer questions. This gives you a chance to get a pre-order. Getting orders before the party is a great way to boost your sales.

Remember this rule of thumb going into your launch party: Keep it Simple. This applies to refreshments, your display, your door prize, and really, every aspect of your party. Module 103 of High Heel Camp provides details you'll need as you gather your party supplies and print customer care cards.

One last important point for today that will boost your launch party attendance: Schedule the time in your calendar to make reminder phone calls 1-2 days before the party. Encourage each person to bring a friend. Plan to call those who haven't yet responded and those who said they were coming. Who doesn't appreciate a friendly reminder?


To create something exceptional, your mindset must be relentlessly focused on the smallest detail.
~Giorgio Armani








Preparation is your word for Day 11! A little preparation will have a tremendous effect on the outcome of your parties, including your launch. Use your time wisely and prepare packets for all of your parties scheduled over the next 45 days. This is an efficient way to work, and you'll discover how great it feels to be prepared. Let's quickly review what you need for your parties and where to find the details in the Initial Training Track of High Heel Camp.

Hostess packets (Module 102). These are a must for efficient and results-oriented hostess coaching.

Sponsoring packets (Module 106). These allow you to create interest in joining your team and increase your credibility as a consultant.

At any given time, there may be a few items in our catalog that have become unavailable from a supplier or are backordered. Be sure to ask your sponsor about the backorder list and discontinued list so you'll be prepared with that information.

Be prepared to schedule specific dates for the parties you'll book from your launch party. To do this, mark your calendar with your open party dates over the next 45 days, or use an open date card (High Heel Camp Module 103).

Doesn't it feel great to be prepared? It's such a confidence-booster. Way to go!


Confidence is the companion of success.

You'll soon be writing customer orders! This is when your business starts to feel very real! Now is a good time to practice completing an order form. Focus on accuracy and not speed. Everyone will understand that you are new and will appreciate your attention to detail.

One special detail about taking orders is inviting customers to round up their total for Charlie's Lunch. Not familiar with our Charlie's Lunch ministry? Read over page 30 in your Initial Action Guide for a wonderful overview. Imagine how fun it will be to share our adorable lunchboxes with everyone! And, how exciting when you realize that 'leftover' change can make such a difference...all because you ask!

Writing orders also means it's time to learn about personalization. By now, you've probably reviewed the Fonts and Graphics Guide that came in your starter kit. The great news is that you don't need to memorize all of that information. You just need to know where to look for answers when someone asks you. In addition to your Fonts and Graphics Guide, High Heel Camp Module 104 will be a great source of information.

Be proud of yourself for reviewing the resources available to you and discovering where to find answers. This is the best way to self-assurance. Remember that your sponsor is here to support you with any remaining questions, too.


If you're not sure where you're going, you'll probably end up somewhere else.

Today will be productive as we focus on two areas of your business! First, Top 10 Party Tips! You were introduced to Intro and Go about a week ago, but as time is getting closer for you to try it out, challenge yourself to learn more. Pull out your Initial Action Guide and jump into pages 19-21.

Second, let's talk about your office-to-go. You'll discover that you'll need marketing materials and business supplies while you are out and about sharing your business. This is where your office-to-go comes in. Find a tote or a small crate to organize your materials so you'll be ready when an opportunity presents itself.

What items will you want to keep in your office-to-go? Catalogs, order forms, look books, hostess and sponsoring packets. Keep thank you notes and pens with you, too, so that you can utilize pockets of time that surface unexpectedly.

It's been another great day for your Initial Outfitters business! We appreciate all that you are doing to get off to a super start!


What we see depends mainly on what we look for.
~ John Lubbock








It's the end of your first two weeks! Can you believe it? Congratulations! It's most likely time to enter your first party order in your virtual office. Don't worry---the system is very user-friendly and we have wonderful tools to guide you. High Heel Camp Module 105 provides an overview of order entry. Also, visit Downloads in your virtual office and click on the New Outfitters...What You Need to Know folder. Locate the document entitled Virtual Office Order Entry Instructions.

You have been utilizing High Heel Camp frequently during these first two weeks. Remember that the suggested timeline is for you to complete all six modules of the Initial Training Track by the time of your launch party. Are you on track to meet that goal? It will be worth it to catch up, if not!

As soon as you finish with the first track, dive into High Heel Camp: The Next Step. This second track covers very important topics including making connections with customers, providing great service, more details on Charlie's Lunch, and much more. We encourage you to set a goal to complete High Heel Camp: The Next Step Track by the end of your first 30 days. You can do it!


Nothing will work unless you do.
~Maya Angelou









Wow! You're at the 15-day mark! We're proud of you for putting the things that you are learning into practice!

Are you ready to stand out in the crowd? Today's subject is one that will surely make your customers and hostesses notice you. It will demonstrate how you value them and will show that you are serious about your new business. We are talking about sending handwritten notes. Sounds simple enough, but it is an activity that will have long-lasting benefits in your business. It is a wonderful relationship-building tool.

Start by sending notes to those who attended your launch party, and then challenge yourself to send notes after every party going forward. In this high-tech world, a handwritten note truly makes you stand out. It is the first step in an effective follow-up system. Visit page 23 in your Initial Action Guide to uncover additional best practices in the area of customer follow-up.


If we did all the things we are capable of, we would literally astound ourselves.
- Thomas Edison









Welcome to your Day 16 action email!

Let's build on yesterday's message by talking about making more meaningful connections in your business. What do you think is the very best way to build relationships that fuel your business? By holding home parties! Your home parties are where you meet new people, connect with those you've previously met, and get referrals of new people to meet. Each new home party you book will give you the opportunity to start a relationship with new people. This is called building your people pipeline. This is a critical component to long-term success in every area of your business.

While personal contact is the best way to establish relationships, Facebook and Pinterest build on the relationships that you have built via high touch communication. Social media allows you to continue the conversation, so to speak. In High Heel Camp: The Next Step, Module 201, you will learn about balancing social media with high touch communication as you make meaningful connections.

Just think of all the new concepts and best practices you are learning. Always rely on these to propel you to reach your dreams!


Well done is better than well said. ~ Benjamin Franklin











We have a super-important topic for Day 17! 

Have you thought about the practice of asking questions as a business tool? When we ask questions, we uncover information, needs, wants and emotions. When we fail to ask, we operate on our own assumptions which can lead to missed opportunities. There are two questions that you want to incorporate into your daily IO vocabulary:

'Have you ever thought about doing what I do?' Practice saying it aloud to see how easy it is! Challenge yourself to use this question in daily conversation at sporting events, church, over lunch with friends, with family members, at parties. Make it a habit to ask every hostess as part of hostess coaching. Ask it everywhere! Ask it often! You will be amazed at the doors that it will open.

'Who do you know?' Asking 'who' questions allows you to reach out to your existing contacts so that you can get to know theirs! Each person you know is your link to others you don’t yet know. So, challenge yourself to step out and start asking: Who do you know who loves personalized products, gifts, jewelry? Who do you know who loves to get together with friends? Who do you know who is a 'party waiting to happen?' Who do you know who needs to earn extra income?

Become comfortable with asking questions and you will learn amazing things that can create opportunities in your business. Be bold. Start asking. Who will you question today?


One thing you can't recycle is wasted time. ~Unknown










Making a difference with your business---what a special subject! And, our Charlie's Lunch partnership allows you to do just that as we feed hungry children in multiple countries through lunchrooms funded by the efforts of Initial Outfitters consultants. Have you thought of how you might want to get involved with this partnership?

Have you begun to invite party guests to round up their orders for Charlie's Lunch? If so, thank you. You may also be selling lunchboxes. If so, thank you. Initial Outfitters donates 100% of the profit from each lunchbox and each Charlie's Cookbook sold. Did you know that when you sell one lunchbox, it feeds a child for a month? When you sell fifteen, you have fed a child for an entire year!

Discover the heartwarming details of the Charlie's Lunch story, and learn about the impact you can make when you complete Module 201 of High Heel Camp: The Next Step. Be sure to view the Charlie's Lunch video featuring our founders that complements the training module.

Share the Charlie's Lunch story during your Intro and Go at your parties and invite guests to get involved. Discuss it during hostess coaching, too. You'll find that many hostesses are eager to spread the word about Charlie's Lunch so that their parties make a difference.


If you can't feed a hundred people, then feed just one. -Mother Teresa











An attitude of service will get you very far in this business! That's our focus for day 19.

Have you ever considered that selling is really serving? When you ask questions at a party to uncover needs, it allows you to serve through sharing information and making suggestions. Your ability to provide one-on-one service at the party, plus regular follow-up after the party, adds great value to the IO shopping experience. Where else does a customer get that type of ongoing service?

Discover more about selling as serving in Module 203 of High Heel Camp: The Next Step. You'll also learn about two other related subjects: how great service increases your chances of obtaining referrals and how to make effective suggestions at your parties.

The time that you spend with each customer at check-out is full of opportunities to grow your business. If you haven't viewed the 'Time of Check-out' video to see a live role play of this important interaction, please do so now. Talk with your sponsor to get her ideas on maximizing check-out time. Practice what you learn so that you find your own natural word choices. Most of all, make serving your customers your passion and the dollars will come!


Always do more than expected: under promise, over deliver.
~Tom Peters










Did you know that learners are earners? That's why we commend you for utilizing High Heel Camp, your Initial Action Guide and these daily action emails! Refer to these training materials and others in your virtual office in the coming months, or anytime that you need a refresher.

Successful consultants never stop learning! They make it a non-negotiable to participate in ongoing training opportunities offered by Initial Outfitters. Many of these are in the form of energizing conference calls where consultants discover the latest news, tools or training, get inspiration from consultant testimonials, connect with the home office staff, and receive recognition. Have you participated in a corporate conference call led by the home office or a team-hosted conference call yet?

Join us at our live training events, too! Ask you sponsor or upline leader why you should attend Spring Training, annual Conference and Shine and Share events throughout the year. You'll have to hear the excitement in her voice to really understand how amazing these events are! They are game-changers!


A leader leads by example, whether he intends to or not. ~ Unknown








We are so excited that you are part of our family of consultants! You've now completed your third week with Initial Outfitters! 

Recently, we talked about handwritten notes and emphasized the importance of sending thank you notes to your launch party guests. That was the beginning of what we call a follow-up system. Follow-up is the key to success in your business! In fact, it won't be long until you hear one of our leaders say that the 'fortune is in the follow-up.'

In Module 204 of High Heel Camp: The Next Step, you will discover a simple system for ongoing follow-up that often begins with a conversation based on customer care cards. Complete this module to discover how to provide excellent service and follow-up by writing notes, making phone calls, utilizing your Signature Style newsletter and more.

Start scheduling a time block in your week now for making follow-up calls so that it becomes a habit. This is a best practice that pays big dividends in your business!


Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the seeds that you plant.
- Robert Louis Stevenson








Welcome to Day 22 where our focus is the gift of your business! Have you thought about your business as a gift to share with others?

At your parties, you will meet women who may be looking for the very thing that you have to offer---a business with Initial Outfitters. They may need additional income (a little or a lot), a flexible job, a change in their lives, connections with new friends, a place to belong. We encourage you to care enough to share.

The process of asking someone to join you as a consultant and supporting them in their new business venture is called sponsoring. Many consultants find that sponsoring is the most gratifying part of their business. Hopefully, you have invited a buddy to join you as we discussed way back in Day 1 of our daily action emails.

Sponsoring and mentoring are such important parts of a thriving business that we have created extensive training on the subjects. Explore our simple 4-step sponsoring process in your Initial Action Guide on page 25. Dive into the details of the process in Module 106 of the Initial Training Track of High Heel Camp. After reviewing these resources, discuss ideas with your sponsor and get started sharing. Your enthusiasm for Initial Outfitters will be magnetic.

Take advantage of the Opportunity Calls hosted by the corporate office and by your team leader. These calls showcase the IO opportunity and help your prospective consultants decide if joining IO is right for them. Check with your sponsor for the call schedule and to learn how to encourage your guests to listen in.

The bottom line? Don't miss out! Share the gift of IO and experience the joy that comes from investing in others and seeing them succeed. Who will you share with today?


Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.
~Mark Twain









Welcome to Day 23! This is a good day for a little self-assessment, don't you think? It's important to periodically assess where you are to determine where improvements may be made so that you can achieve your goals. It's also important to highlight where you are succeeding so you can celebrate your victories, large and small! So, are you ready?

Let's start with High Heel Camp: The Next Step. Are you on track to complete it by the end of your first 30 days? Which best practices have you learned that you might want to review?

Have you completed your Initial Action Guide?

Are you beginning to feel more confident coaching your hostesses?

Are you having fun at your parties? Is your Intro and Go feeling more comfortable, and are you beginning to see some results from the booking and sponsoring seeds you are planting?

Are you sharing your enthusiasm for your new business everywhere you go? YOU are your best advertisement!

Are you asking others if they have ever thought of joining you?

Are you asking others who they know?

Wow! Just reading over these questions emphasizes all that you have learned and tried over the past three weeks. Your commitment to jumping in with both feet is something worth celebrating in itself---so hats off to you! Every effort gets you closer to your goals. You have come a long way in 3 weeks!


Don't be afraid to give up the good to go for the great.
~John D. Rockefeller











Do you like to be 'in the know?' An Outfitter who is knowledgeable about her products has more credibility with her customers. Does this mean you have to know everything about your products? No way! You just need to know where you can find information.

When you are knowledgeable, customers will see you as their go-to source for great products. Hostesses will be eager for you to help their friends with product solutions, and will be more inclined to refer their friends to you. When you are knowledgeable, you appear more professional, which draws more women to you with the possibility of joining your team.

Where do you find product information? Your catalog is your best resource. Other resources include your monthly consultant newsletter called The Monogram, the Social Media folder and the Catalog Info and Guide folder in Downloads in your virtual office, and home office posts on the Initial Outfitters Facebook page. Another wonderful resource is your customer newsletter, Signature Style.

Speaking of Signature Style, you will be receiving your first Warm Call Report soon. The Warm Call Report enables you to follow up with high touch communication based on your customers' interests. Review Module 201 of High Heel Camp: The Next Step for details. Be sure to read the sample conversation starters as supporting documents for the module, too.

The tools you've learned about today are wonderful resources, but you must use them to see the rewards! You can do it!


Strive for progress, not perfection.

Parties---what a fun topic for your 25th day! Initial Outfitters parties are all about fun! And, when you have parties on your calendar, you are 'IN' business.

Your parties are the place to book more parties, to build your customer base, to meet women who might want to join your team, and to make connections so that you get referrals. This is why we say that parties are the lifeblood of your business.

So, how do you book more parties? How do you move outside your current circle of friends and family? Where do you find party leads? These are important questions to ask at this point in your business, and they are addressed in Module 205 of High Heel Camp: The Next Step. Take some time now to complete this module.

Seek input from your sponsor as you step out of your comfort zone to book more parties. Remember that party leads are everywhere! So, be confident in what you have to offer as you invite others to host. You have amazing products, an amazing catalog, fabulous specials, fun parties, and great hostess rewards! Invite, invite, invite!


Obstacles are those frightful things you see when you take your eyes off your goals.
~Henry Ford










Welcome to Day 26! We're going to build on a topic that is a perfect complement to our recent discussion on asking questions. Today, let's look at effective listening.

When you train yourself to listen at your parties, you'll discover a myriad of opportunities! When someone asks how many parties you do each month, or how much you enjoy being a consultant, she may be curious about doing what you do. When someone asks how many people a hostess has to gather for it to be considered a party, she is more than likely interested in hosting, but is unsure of herself. When you overhear two guests talking about one of them leaving her job soon, or a daughter getting married, those are opportunities for you to explore through conversation.

For examples of how to turn conversations into coffee chats, go back and review the three brief Prospecting videos that are part of Module 106 of the Initial Training Track of High Heel Camp. Use the same techniques to make the most of your conversations at your parties.

Your success begins with your commitment to being proactive. Ask questions and listen. Engage the women at your parties in conversation. When you do, all kinds of great things can happen!


Leaders are made, they are not born. They are made by hard effort, which is the price which all of us must pay to achieve any goal that is worthwhile.
~Vince Lombardi








Two interesting terms deserve your attention today---POP and IGNITE! These terms apply to monthly sales benchmarks in your business. To POP means to personally sell $1200 personal volume (PV) in a given month. To IGNITE means to personally sell $2000 PV in a given month. Reaching these levels enables you to earn significant income from your party commissions, and they put you on the track for consistency bonuses. They also put you on track for earning higher Super STARt rewards and ongoing incentives that are available to all Outfitters.

What is the key to hitting these benchmarks? Consistency. Consistently booking and holding home parties each and every month. We suggest about a party per week to help you achieve higher income and rewards levels. Set a goal to book two parties from each party. Ask for referrals. Use the opportunities that present themselves in your daily routine to meet new people who you can invite to host parties.

Do these strategies sound familiar? They should! They are among the many best practices you have been learning about from your training resources. Refresh yourself on these best practices in the coming months, too.

As others join you in the business, it is equally as important to steer them to these resources. We know you want to be the best sponsor possible. For more information on working with your new team members to set them up for a super start, complete Module 206 in High Heel Camp: The Next Step. Make it a point to print the Sponsor Checklist and New Outfitter Tracker for each of the new consultants you have sponsored and use them to stay on track as a sponsor. These are supporting documents for Module 206.

Continue learning as you position yourself to POP---or even IGNITE---and as you invest in the success of those you sponsor!

You may have noticed that we love acronyms at Initial Outfitters. That means that it's a perfect day to introduce you to two new acronyms...POW and PERK!

POW and PERK are the components of a simple system (we love simple systems, too!) to help you manage your Initial Outfitters work time so that you focus on income-producing and relationship-building activities. Your Initial Action Guide dedicates pages 28 and 29 to POW and PERK. You'll also find information about POW and PERK and other organizational tips in Module 207 of High Heel Camp: The Next Step.

Every Outfitter must organize and integrate her business into her already-busy life. So, start creating a simple work plan each week while you are still new to the business so that it will become a habit. This will enable you to maintain balance in your business by keeping your priorities in order.

One of your priorities over the course of the past four weeks has been completing your Initial Action Guide and both tracks of High Heel Camp. If you haven't yet completed those, we encourage you to do so as quickly as possible. In fact, write that down now as you see how easy it is to start your first POW!


History will be kind to me- for I intend to write it.

It is Day 29 of your new business and you have one full month with Initial Outfitters under your belt! Kudos to you! We are so excited that you are part of our team!

Keep it simple: this is today's subject. Throughout these four weeks, you've discovered many new concepts, best practices, systems, and tools that will empower you to realize your goals with Initial Outfitters. It is your turn now to utilize these new discoveries to maintain a simple and duplicable business.

Duplicability is something we haven't talked about yet. Being duplicable means that others see what you do and find it appealing and intriguing because it looks like something they could do. They have a desire to learn more because you have invited them to see themselves in your shoes. They may even believe they can do things better than you!

So, ask yourself regularly if your parties are duplicable, and as you mentor others, if you are embracing best practices in a way that is duplicable. Are you using the simple tools and systems we have offered you? Resolve today to keep your business simple. Not only will this maintain the FUN in your business, it will help you grow and succeed.


You have brains in your head and feet in your shoes, you can steer yourself in any direction you choose!

It's day 30 and this is your last Daily Action Email! Congratulations and thank you for your persistence! As we celebrate your 30th day with Initial Outfitters, allow these thoughts from our founders to encourage and challenge you:

While most of us are not pilots, each of us either knows someone who is a pilot or we understand how they come to earn their pilot's license. As a quick refresher, pilots are required to do several things before they can ever dream about flying a plane on their own. They must attend flight school. They must put what they have learned into practical application. They must log a certain number of flight hours before they can fly by themselves. They must keep accumulating those hours in order to promote in the opportunities that the job provides.

How does this apply to you? Think of it this way. If you have a goal of earning a certain income with IO or working to reach a particular title in our compensation plan, you are probably not going to wake up in the morning having reached either of those benchmarks without putting in some "flight hours" of your own.

When it comes to your IO business, a flight hour would be an important income-producing activity like making booking phone calls, making follow-up opportunity calls, going out to do a party, hosting opportunity interviews, and placing follow-up calls. You can log 'flight time' in several ways but the activities that will help you build those hours are very simple - party, sponsor, and care for your customers.

Many people find themselves frustrated when they haven't promoted or hit certain sales levels that another Outfitter has achieved in just a few months' time. It's easy to feel tempted to compare yourself, make excuses, or try to justify why she''s accomplishing certain things that you have not yet accomplished.

First and foremost, comparison is a thief of joy. Just don't do it. Secondly, you may find that what has happened is that she has simply logged more flight hours than you. Perhaps you did 4 parties this month and met with one prospect. That's great! If we were keeping track it would be about 5 flight hours. On the other hand, the other Outfitter averaged 2 parties a week, spoke with 6 prospects, and spent an hour each week doing some customer care calls. That would be more like 18 flight hours. So you can see why she might be progressing at a pace that is faster than yours. She has just logged more flight time.

Do pilots always have control over when and how often they can fly? No, not really. Often pilots might find themselves with a plan to spend 6 hours flying one day and a storm comes rolling in. Just like that he has gone from being able to earn six hours down to nothing.

Do you always have control over whether or not you can log flight hours? No, but you have more control than the pilot. When a party reschedules, you can decide that your party cancelled and that's it, no flight time. However, you can take the time you were going to spend at the party and use it another way. Calling from your warm list to book a few more parties, or touching base with people that have expressed interest in learning more about IO are all income-producing activities that get you flight time. You can work on customer care or you can listen to a few trainings. There are lots of ways you can keep working toward the flight hours you need to do anything you want to in this business. So, when you are having a less then fantastic day with IO just remember, good or bad, when you keep working toward logging your flight hours, you will be making progress.

Anytime you are thrilled or less than thrilled with your results, think for a moment, what was my activity for the month? How many fight hours did I log? In what areas were they? Very often looking at it that way will give you great perspective.

This business, like any other, will have a natural cycle. What we find is that when you plan for all of those cycles and work through them by doing the activities that are important to your success, you will find that you are piloting the exact business you desire.

It is wonderful to have you as a member of the Initial Outfitters Family. We are so very excited to share all of your future successes with you.
